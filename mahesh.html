	<p>Early career and breakthrough (1979–2003)
At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[21] During the shoot of Poratam (1983) at Vauhini Studios, after watching Babu on the sets, director Kodi Ramakrishna suggested to Krishna that he cast Babu in the role of the protagonist's brother. Initially terrified, Babu agreed to act in the film after being persuaded by the film's crew.[21] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989). Babu then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990). Later, he continued his college studies.[22]</p>
<p>Mainstream film acclaim and success (2004–2010)
Manjula produced his next film, Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast was commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[28] He received the Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[36] The failure of Naani depressed both Babu and Manjula, who took a small break in Goa before resuming their other commitments.[37] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu, co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[38] Athadu became one of the highest-grossing films of the year.[39] The film was a commercially profitable venture for the producers and distributors.[40] The film benefited Babu's career as he won the Nandi Best Actor Award for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[41] Athadu collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[42] Idlebrain gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[43]

Babu collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[44] Made on a budget of ₹10 crore and shot within six months,[45] Pokiri became the highest grossing Telugu film of all time by the end of its run, and was screened at the 7th IIFA Awards held in Dubai.[</p>

<p>Family
During the shoot of B. Gopal's Vamsi at Australia, Babu began to date his co-star Namrata Shirodkar. After being in a relationship for four years, they decided to get married, and Manjula convinced Krishna in favour of their decision.[19] They were married on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu.[201] The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[202] The boy, named Gautham Krishna, was a premature baby and was in critical condition during his birth. His condition turned stable after the doctors treated him in time.[92] On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[203] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[204]

Babu is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[205] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer, director, and an actress.[citation needed] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[206]

Telugu actress and filmmaker Vijaya Nirmala was Babu's step-mother, and actor Naresh is his step-brother.[207]

Philanthropy
Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[208] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[2</p>

	<p>In September 2004, Babu and director Gunasekhar attended a rally organised by his fans at Warangal for the promotional activities of Arjun. He and his fans allegedly raided two video libraries and assaulted their owners who were circulating unauthorised CDs of the film. Cases under IPC section 448 (criminal trespass), section 427 (mischief) and section 366 (kidnap) were registered on him, who was the principal accused, and five others.[214] Later, a delegation from the Telugu film industry, including his father Krishna, Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Allu Aravind and D. Suresh Babu, approached the then chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to intervene in this case. Regarding the issue, Babu said that while cases were booked against him on "the basis of wrong information," not a single case had been booked against the person dealing in bootlegged CDs, which he found the "funniest" thing.[215] Actor Pawan Kalyan openly supported Babu throughout the episode.[216] Babu surrendered in the district court in September 2004 and appeared before the court again in April 2006. Babu and the others were exonerated after the final hearing in July 2006.[217]

Their family hails from Burripalem in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.[13] Babu spent his childhood mostly in Madras under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of his family.[14] Since Krishna was busy with his film commitments, Ramesh Babu used to look after Mahesh Babu's academic performance.[12] Along with his siblings, Babu used to play cricket regularly at the VGP Golden beach in Madras. To spend time with him, Krishna used to make sure that his films' shoots would be conducted at the VGP Universal Kingdom during the weekends.[12]

Krishna also made sure that none of his children would reveal his name during their schooling to ensure a peaceful environment.[12] He was educated at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai where actor Karthi was his schoolmate.[15][16] Babu in an interview said that actor Vijay and he have been longtime close friends and studied at the same college,[17] before establishing themselves in their respective film industries.[18] Babu was an above average student. He obtained a bachelor's degree in commerce from the Loyola College, Chennai.[19] After graduating, he met with director L. Satyanand in Vishakhapatnam for further training in acting which went on for three to four months.[19] Being unable to read and write Telugu, he used to memorise the dialogues given by his directors during the dubbing phase of his films.[20]</p>
